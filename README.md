# Kitchen-Chaos
This 'Kitchen Chaos' project was built based on the fantastic tutorial by the YouTuber Code Monkey. My primary goal was to learn and apply key Unity skills, including player controls, game state management, and UI implementation. The project demonstrates my ability to build a complete game loop from start to finish.
